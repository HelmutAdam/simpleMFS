=== SimpleDc

A simple Device Controller using FIFO to process incoming orders. +
For choosing the next order the priority and sequence parameters are not taken into consideration, 
it solely depends on the order input sequence. +
Adding an order starts the connected device. If a device error occurs a log message is created, no further actions are taken.
