= Job Application Project

This is a small project creating a fully automated storage system.

The material flow system (MFS) sends orders to a Device Controller which processes and forwards them to a Device for execution. 
Each Device asynchronously executes its current order.

An order contains the location (x-coordinate and side) of the source and destination, a unique ID, the priority and sequence for the DC to handle.
